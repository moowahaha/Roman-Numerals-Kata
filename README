Code kata taken from http://nosuchblogger.com/post/36/code-kata-roman-numerals-intro .

The problem is on the face of it very simple and represents a good
intro to a coding dojo as the problem itself won't add confusion to
developers learning TDD (or even Ruby!).

The problem is this:

RomanNumeral.new('X').to_i  #=> 10
RomanNumeral.new('XX').to_i #=> 20

Etc.

A very simple passing test has been supplied.
