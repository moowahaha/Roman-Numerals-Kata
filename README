Code kata taken from http://nosuchblogger.com/post/36/code-kata-roman-numerals-intro .

The problem is on the face of it very simple and represents a good
intro to a coding dojo as the problem itself won't add confusion to
developers learning TDD (or even Ruby!). This task can also spin out
to be hugely complex too!

The problem is this:

RomanNumeral.new('X').to_i  #=> 10
RomanNumeral.new('XX').to_i #=> 20

Etc.

A very simple passing test has been supplied.

And for those not aware of roman numerals:
